# [MUST READ] Welcome to WDB's frontend technical project!

This project is designed for **you** to gauge whether you want to apply to the **bootcamp** or **industry** branch. Follow the steps below to finish and submit your project. Do not be discouraged if you get stuck. Completing all tasks for the branch you are applying to is highly preferred, but we will only assess your project based on whatever you submit to us.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [our email](webatberkeley@gmail.com).

## Introduction

The Grand Cheese Race has been the most elite sporting event for thousands of years. Every year, each country sends one honorable representative to compete for the Double Gloucester cheese. This year, for the first time in history, all living previous victors are coming to compete for the Golden Double Gloucester cheese. Our client is organizing the Grand Cheese Race and wants to build a website to allow spectators to vote for who they think will win. They asked you to program the website for them. The specifications are listed below.

Also, this page may potentially keep changing if we get some frequently asked questions, so keep this repository bookmarked and check back on it every now and then! If there are any major changes, we'll make sure to email you about those.
